# Our-Lab-in-a-Box

The purpose of this project is to create a standardized access control platform for our labs based around Apache Guacamole and Keycloak.

Instructions for building a working environment can be found under "documentation" in the file Lab-in-a-Box Identity Management and Remote Access.adoc.  This is an AsciiDoc file which like Markdown, can be converted to various formats.
