:description: This document describes the process for deploying a standardized set of tools for baseline access control in the NCCoE lab environments.  The goal of these tools are to provide for identity management, authentication, authorization, and to provide SSH / RDP / VNC / etc access to VM consoles running in the lab environment while logging those accesses.  If possible, this platform will allow self-service identity management capabilities such as changing user passwords and lost password recoveries and single-sign-on for Windows and Linux hosts.  This platform, as described, leverages DNS and Certificate Authority capabilities of the lab's pfSense router.  It also leverages the MinIO platform for Amazon S3-type object storage to support basic backup and restore operations for the various datasets needed by the other services in the platform.  In each case, our intent is to allow these services to be exchanged with other providers should your specific lab needs require you to use a different set of tools.

[preface]
== Preface

Most of the NCCoE labs use custom-built infrastructures for controlling the access of NCCoE and Collaborator staff to the resources deployed in the lab environment.  

:toc:

== Overview

Managing access to lab resources to the appropriate NCCoE or Collaborator staff requires a multi-layered solution, including firewalls and VPNs provided by NIST and the NCCoE IT Ops team, as well as firewalls and other protections implemented locally within the lab.  At this time, policy interpretation does not allow a lab to leverage the usernames and passwords NCCoE staff and Collaborator staff select for VPN access to the NCCoE lab environment.  This requires each lab to establish its on Identity and Access Management solution.  Each lab is responsible for protecting the equipment, software, and data that collaborators entrust with the NCCoE.

=== Requirements for the Access Control Platform

NOTE: TODO:  Complete this section.

=== High-level Architecture

The following diagram provides a high-level description of the basic physical architecture employed to provide Identity and Access Management functions in the lab.

.Example Remote Access and Identity Management Architecture
image::Lab_Remote_Access_Arch.svg[]

This document describes an approach, accompanied by a high-level architectural description and deployment instructions, for a standardized infrastructure for managing identity and access in a lab environment using the following open source tools:

    * Keycloak (centralized IAM), 
    * OpenLDAP (directory services),
    * phpLDAPAdmin (directory access),
    * MariaDB (relational database storage), 
    * Guacamole (SSH/RDP/VNC gateways), and 
    * pfSense (firewall, routing, certificate authority, and DNS).

=== Summary Approach for Deployment

As you can see from the architecture diagram, the approach uses a single server running Docker to run, in Docker containers, most of the software components used to allow self-service of lab participant identity, including username selection, password changes, and in the future, password resets by email.  Apache Guacamole includes basic authentication and authorization capabilities internally, but can defer authentication to outside identity providers such as Keycloak or LDAP providers.  In our setup, Apache Guacamole defers authentication to Keycloak.  Keycloak provides an OpenID Connect-based authentication feature that Guacamole defers to.  Keycloak in turn can manage multiple realms.  We set up a realm to manage lab users.  This realm is configured to federate identity information with an OpenLDAP server.  In the future, OpenLDAP may be exchanged with ActiveDirectory to faciliate single-sign-on (SSO) with Windows machines operating in the lab.  Currently, with OpenLDAP, only linux machines can be configured for SSO.

As best practice for Docker/containerization, each database is hosted by a separate MariaDB container instance.  In the current build there are two databases, one configured for Guacamole to store credential and authorization information, and one for Keycloak for storing and managing credential information for the lab realm.

Finally, the approach uses Caddy as a Docker/container-aware reverse proxy (known as an egress container).  Caddy is responsible for exposing and routing all HTTP and HTTPS traffic to any of the docker containers and routes traffic from specific fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to specific containers based on container name.  To enable this functionality, each container exposing a web end-point must have its own unique FQDN, even though all of those FQDNs will resolve to a single IP.  Outside the lab environment, these names should resolve to an IP address on the WAN or VENDORNET.  Internal to the lab, the FQDN should resolve to the appropriate address on 192.168.0.x network.

== Basic Configurations

There are some basic environment configurations you should perform before establishing the services for Guacamole.

=== Summary of Configuration Naming Schemes and Approaches

To make automatic configuration of this environment possible, the lab should use a methodical and consistent naming convention.  The scripts will create or expect items to be created using specific names.  Almost all entries in the configuration scripts are keyed off your lab abbreviation which should be unique to your lab and used by no others.

==== VM and Service Naming Conventions

Most of the services, systems, and related resources will be named based on a short abbreviation of your lab name.  This abbreviation should be at least four characters long and should be as unique as you can make it.  Additionally, your lab will have a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) associated with it.  This FQDN will be of the form <lab-abbreviation>-lab.nccoe.<suffix>.  You will specify the suffix to be used.  The default to use for a suffix is "test".  If you will be accessing these machines outside of the lab environment, you may wish to use "org".

NOTE: If you use .org as the suffix for your lab's FQDN, you may need to take additional steps for acquiring externally useable SSL certificates.

Based on your lab abbreviation and FQDN suffix, a script will compute the FQDN of each of the virtual servers, docker containers, and related resources

NOTE: TODO:  Complete this section.

==== The Configuration Script

This document describes the components of the access control platform and how each is configured with the goal that the instructions would allow you to configure the components by hand.  However, the lengthy configuration files and numerous places for verbose and repetitive replacements lend this task to automation.  To simplify lab setup, a python script has been provided that reads a few configuration settings from a file and then produces customized configuration files that should dramatically simplify configuring the lab.

If you choose to use the configuration script, do so after the steps for establishing the jumpbox VM using the base docker image (<<_setup_the_remote_virtual_machine>>)

The script can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kentj/Our-Lab-in-a-Box/main/scripts/configure_lab.py[].  Use curl or wget on the command-line of the home folder on the Docker server that will host the services.

`curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kentj/Our-Lab-in-a-Box/main/scripts/configure_lab.py`

The example lab_config.ini file can be downloaded using:

`curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kentj/Our-Lab-in-a-Box/main/scripts/lab_config.ini`

=== Firewall Configurations

The firewall must be configured to all access into the lab.  In pfSense, this will be accomplished by establishing two Network Address Translation (NAT) rules.  NCCoE labs generally do not use routable IP addresses inside the lab, including private IPs in the 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16 network blocks.  NAT intercepts traffic with routable IP addresses and forwards the traffic to a machine in your network with a non-routable IP address (such as 192.168.0.2 in our running example).  These forwards are bi-directional, allowing the internal server to respond to the original client.  pfSense typically blocks or drops traffic at the firewall by default.  When you create these NAT rules through the pfSense UI, it will automatically create additional firewall rules that will allow traffic to the HTTP and HTTPS ports.

Access into the lab will be through the NCCoE GlobalProtect VPN.  The VPN allows an individual to connect from the Internet, and then gives them an IP address into the NCCoE private corporate network.  The VPN is configured to give NCCoE government and MITRE staff an IP address in one range, and Vendor/Collaborator staff an IP address in a different range.  The NCCoE staff IP address range allows access to your WAN network addresses, plus other services such as gitlab, the wiki, and the vSphere console.  The Vendor/Collaborator staff address range is restricted to accessing IP addresses on your VENDORNET network.  This means to support both types of staff, your lab will have two entry points, one on your WAN network, and one on your VENDORNET network.  The IP addresses for your WAN and VENDORNET segments were provided to you by IT OPs at the time your lab was established.  You need to select one from each list.

The network information provided from IT Ops comes with four pieces of information:  VLAN, Network, GW, Netmask.  Here is an example of one configuration:

.Example NCCoE Staff Access Network Information
[cols='1,6']
|===
|*VLAN*
|WAN

|*Network*
|10.32.50.32/28

|*Gateway*
|10.32.50.33

|*Netmask*
|255.255.255.240
|===

The first IP address in each list is your network gateway and can not be used.  The first usable IP address in this example is 10.32.50.34.

An example from a collaborator's perspective, with a first usable address being 10.32.50.50:

.Example Collaborator Access Network Information
[cols='1,6']
|===
|*VLAN*
|VENDORNET

|*Network*
|10.32.50.48/28

|*Gateway*
|10.32.50.49

|*Netmask*
|255.255.255.240
|===

The netmask is used to compute the size of the IP address range.  In the two examples, the netmask 240 means only the last 4 bits can be used, giving an IP address range in the last example of 10.32.50.48-10.32.50.63.  The first address is reserved for the network name (.48), the second address is reserved for the gateway (.49) and the last address is reserved for the network broadcast address (.63) meaning the usable IP addresses are 10.32.50.50 through 10.32.50.62.  You can find a network address calculator at https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html[].

Once you know the IP address you will use for each range, you will need to instruct pfSense to NAT traffic to those addresses to the guacamole server.

.Configure pfSense Firewall NAT Rules
image::Main-menu-pfSense-Port-Forwarding-NAT-Menu.png[]

.Add a pfSense Firewall NAT Rule for Port Forwarding
image::Add-pfSense-NAT-Port-Forwarding-Rule.png[]


The _Destination_ in pfSense firewall NAT rules refers to the routable IP address and port that a client would be addressing.  The _Target_ in pfSense firewall NAT rules refers to the internal host inside your lab that pfSense should redirect traffic addressed to _Destination_.  _Destination_ will refer to your WAN on VENDORNET IPs.  _Target_ will always refer to your internal server.

The Destination interface will be either WAN or VENDORNET.

.Choose the Destination Interface
image::pfSense-NAT-Rule-Interface.png[]

The Destination Protocol will be TCP.

.Choose the Destination Protocol
image::pfSense-NAT-Rule-Protocol.png[]

The Destination IP address will be the IP address you selected from the WAN or VENDORNET lists accordingly.

.Choose the Destination IP Address
image::pfSense-NAT-Rule-Destination-Address.png[]

This is where you will select the port to forward.  You will need rules for both HTTP and HTTPS.

.Choose the Destination Port
image::pfSense-NAT-Rule-Destination-Port.png[]

This is where you will give the IP address on your internal network for your guacamole host.  In the examples we've given this will be 192.168.0.2.

.Choose the Target IP
image::pfSense-NAT-Rule-Target-IP.png[]

This is where you will select the port to receive the traffic.  THIS SHOULD ALWAYS MATCH THE DESTINATION PORT you selected for the rule.

.Choose the Target Port
image::pfSense-NAT-Rule-Target-Port.png[]

NAT port forwarding rules are complicated.  Do yourself a favor and name the rule so that you describe what it is doing.

.Describe the NAT Rule
image::pfSense-NAT-Rule-Description.png[]

Save the rule.

.Save the NAT Rule
image::Save-pfSense-NAT-Rule.png[]

Follow these steps to ensure you forward traffic from both the WAN IP and the VENDORNET IP to the target host, with rules for both HTTP and HTTPS. Make sure you choose to `Apply Changes` before exiting the NAT rules interface in pfSense.  The table below summarizes, by example, the four rules you should create.

.Summary of Needed Port Fowarding Rules for Example Setup
[cols='1,2,1,2,2,2,2,6']
|===
|*Rule* |*Interface* |*Protocol* |*Destination IP* |*Destination Port* |*Target IP* |*Target Port*  |*Description*
|1 |WAN |TCP |10.32.50.33 |HTTP |192.168.0.2 |HTTP |Rule to forward HTTP traffic from NCCoE staff to guacamole server
|2 |WAN |TCP |10.32.50.33 |HTTPS |192.168.0.2 |HTTPS |Rule to forward HTTPS traffic from NCCoE staff to guacamole server
|3 |VENDORNET |TCP |10.32.50.50 |HTTP |192.168.0.2 |HTTP |Rule to forward HTTP traffic from vendor staff to guacamole server
|4 |VENDORNET |TCP |10.32.50.50 |HTTPS |192.168.0.2 |HTTPS |Rule to forward HTTPS traffic from vendor staff to guacamole server
|===


=== DNS Configurations
In your DNS server (pfSense in the default lab install) set up the name resolutions required by your lab.  Using pfSense, this is accomplished from the `Services` then `DNS Resolver` menu selection.

.Access pfSense DNS Resolver Configuration Interface
image::Open-pfSense-DNS-Resolver-Service.png[]

On the General Settings tab, ensure the pfSense `DNS Resolver` is enabled.

.Enable pfSense DNS Resolver Service
image::Main-menu-pfSense-DNS-Resolver.png[]

To add a host entry, click the `Add` button just below and to the far right of the Host Overrides section of the page.

.Add Host Resolver Entry in pfSense
image::Add-Host-pfSense-DNS-Resolver.png[]

Add entries for the following machines in the Host Overrides section, using the IP addresses appropriate for your lab setup:

 . guacamole.[labname]-lab.nccoe.test (IP Address: 192.168.0.2)
 . keycloak.[labname]-lab.nccoe.test (IP Address: 192.168.0.2)
 . php-ldap-admin.[labname]-lab.nccoe.test  (IP Address: 192.168.0.2)
 . openldap.[labname]-lab.nccoe.test (IP Address: 192.168.0.2)
 . minio.[labname]-lab.nccoe.test (IP Address: 192.168.0.4)
 . remote.[labname]-lab.nccoe.test (IP Address: 192.168.0.2)
 . ad.[labname]-lab.nccoe.test (IP Address: 192.168.0.5)

Make sure you choose to `Apply Changes` before exiting the DNS Resolver interface of pfSense.

.Apply DNS Resolver Changes in pfSense
image::Apply-Changes-DNS-Resolver.png[]

=== Certificate Authority Configurations

There are many options for creating and managing certificate authorities.  In these instructions, we are using the built-in GUI for pfSense which is already available in the default lab environment.  In this step we will be 1) creating the lab Root Certficiate Authority, 2) creating the lab's intermediate Certificate Authority, 3) exporting the certificates and keys for both the root authority and the intermediate authority.

NOTE: Creating an intermediate certificate authority is optional.  It is fine for short-lived labs to sign certificates directly from the root authority.  If you decide to use an intermediate authority you may need to alter some of the certificate chain files used later.

To access the pfSense Certificate Management interface, select the `Cert. Manager` from `System` on the main menu.

.Accessing the pfSense Certificate Management GUI
image::Open-pfSense-CertificateManager.png[]

Once the interface has loaded, you will see three tabs, `CAs` for creating certificate authorities, `Certificiates` for creating server certificates, and `Certificate Revocation` which we will not be using.

.pfSense Certificate Manager Main Menu
image::Main-menu-pfSense-Certificate-Manager.png[]

==== Create the Root Certificate Authority
First, select the `CA` tab to create the root Certificate Authority.  Click the `Add` button in the bottom right of the screen to create the authority.

.pfSense Create Root Certificate Authority
image:Create-pfSense-CA-IntermediateCA.png[]

Fill in the form using the following values with items not mentioned using the default:

 * Descriptive Name: <Lab Abbreviation>-Lab Root Certificate Authority
 * Method: Create an internal Certificate Authority
 * Randomize Serial:  <checked>
 * Key type: RSA  - <4096>
 * Country Code: US
 * State or Province: MD
 * City: Rockville
 * Organization: NCCoE
 * Organizational Unit: <Lab Abbreviation>-Lab

Then click the `Save` button.  The certificate authority has been created, and will appear in the list on the resulting page.

To export the root certificate authority certificate, first find the root certificate authority in the list, and click the star icon on the far right side.  The image below places a red box around the appropriate icon.  The browswer will download a `.crt` file named from your Descriptive Name to your downloads folder.

.pfSense - Export Root Certificate Authority
image::Export-pfSense-CertificateAuthority.png[]

You will also need to download the Certificate Authority key.  Click the key icon on the far right side of the certificate authority's list entry.  The image below places a red box around the appropriate icon.  The browser will download a `.key` file named from your Descriptive Name to your downloads folder.

.pfSense - Export Root Certificate Authority Key
image::Export-pfSense-CertificateAuthorityKey.png[]

==== Create the Intermediate Certificate Authority

NOTE: This step is optional.

Use the same steps as for the root authority, except choose:

 * Method: Create an intermediate Certificate Authority
 
This will show a new option:

 * Signing Certificate Authority: Choose the Root Certificate Authority you created above.

Complete the remaining steps, including export of the certificate and keys as above.

=== Creating the Server Certificates

You will create *server* certificates for the following machines:

. guacamole.<labname>-lab.nccoe.<fqdn>
. keycloak.<labname>-lab.nccoe.<fqdn>
. minio.<labname>-lab.nccoe.<fqdn>
. remote.<labname>-lab.nccoe.<fqdn>

To create a certificate, first select the `Certificate` menu from the pfSense Certificate Manager.

.pfSense - Certificate Management UI under Certificate Menu
image::Main-menu-pfSense-Certificate-Manager.png[]

This will bring up a screen that will allow you to browse the certificates you have made and to create new ones.  To create a certificate, click the `Add/Sign` button in the bottom right of the page.

.pfSense - Add Certificate Button
image::Create-pfSense-Certificates.png[]

This will bring up the screen captured in the following two images:

.pfSense - Create Server Certificate
image::pfSense-Create-Server-Certificate-A.png[]

.pfSense - Create Server Certificate (continued)
image::pfSense-Create-Server-Certificate-B.png[]

Under *Add/Sign a New Certificate* choose the following values:

* _Method_:  Create an internal Certificate
* _Descriptive Name_: Use the FQDN for the server as listed above

Under *Internal Certificate* choose the following values:

* _Certificate Authority_: If you created an intermediate CA choose it.  If you did not, choose the root CA.
* _Common Name_: Use the FQDN for the server as listed above

Under *Certificate Attributes* choose the following values:

* _Certificate Type_: Server Certificate

All other settings can be left at their default.

Click the `Save` button at the bottom of the screen to create the certificate.

After creating each certficate, export the certificate (.crt) and key (.key) files for each.

To export a certificate, click the radial starburst icon as seen in the image below.

.pfSense Export Server Certificate
image::Export-pfSense-Certificate.png[]

To export the certificates private key, click the key icon as seen in the image below.

.pfSense Export Server Certificate Private Key
image::Export-pfSense-CertificateKey.png[]

== Setup the Virtual Machines

Each of the VMs we will be establishing will rely on Docker (or Podman).  Docker can be run on a number of Linux-based operating systems.  In this guide, we will be using the Ubuntu 20.04 template found in the vSphere template folder.  This template contains most of the software you will need during the install process including _curl_ and _python3_.  Our approach to setting up these servers will be first create an informal VM template based on the Ubuntu 20.04 template that has the common docker software installed, and then clone that informal template for the three Docker-based VMs.

=== Creating a Base Docker Image ===

To create our base docker image, we will follow three steps:  fixing the configuration of the _apt_ package on the base Ubuntu template, installing _docker_, and then adding the _administrator_ user to the _docker_ group in order to simplify command-line access to containers.

==== Fix the configuration of _apt_

The out of the box Ubuntu 20.04 image has a configuration setting that prevents the box from running software updates and software installs.  You must comment out two lines in a configuration file to allow _apt_ to work correctly.

* `sudo pico /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90curtin-aptproxy`
* `sudo pico /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf`
* place a `#` in front of each line in the file
* Press `Ctrl-x`
* Press `y`
* Press `Enter`

==== Install _docker_.

These instructions for installing Docker are based on the article [Setup Docker Repositories w/ APT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu) at [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu).  To use the latest _docker-compose_ file syntax and features, we are leveraging the _compose_ sub-command of _docker_ (_docker compose_) rather than the _docker-compose_ script for coordinated container deployment and orchestration.  The scripts we have provided generally do not work with _docker-compose_.

==== Add the _administrator_ user to the _docker_ group.

After installing Docker, edit _/etc/group_ and add the _administrator_ account to the _docker_ group.  This allows you to manage docker containers on the CLI without constant use of _sudo_.

`sudo pico /etc/group`

Find the (ctrl-w) the line for the _docker_ group.  The list of users in the group follows the third colon (`:`) character on that line.  Type `administrator` at the end of that comma-separated list.  If the list is empty, just type it after the last (third) colon.  Exit the _pico_ editor by typing (ctrl-x), Y, and then (enter).

After the edit, the line in _/etc/group_ should look something like this:

`docker:x:998:administrator`

=== Setup the _Remote_ Virtual Machine

The _remote_ VM is where the _Guacamole_ related Docker containers will be deployed.  Follow these steps for setting up this VM:

 . Clone the template Docker VM in vSphere and name the clone "Remote" in vSphere.
 . Configure the virtual machine networking stack:
    * Edit _/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml_ to assign the VM a static IPv4 address.  We selected _192.168.1.2_.  Use a value that makes sense for your lab.
    * Edit _/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml_ to ensure the VM DNS servers point to the pfSense DNS server.
    +
    * After both edits, the file should look something like this:

....
 # This file is generated from information provided by
 # the datasource.  Changes to it will not persist across an instance.
 # To disable cloud-init's network configuration capabilities, write a file
 # /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
 # network: {config: disabled}
 network:
     version: 2
     ethernets:
         ens192:
             addresses: [192.168.1.2/24]
             gateway4: 192.168.1.1
             nameservers:
                 addresses: [192.168.1.1]
....

    * Edit _/etc/hostname_ to set the VM hostname to _remote.*<lab abbreviation>*-lab.nccoe.test_.
    
    * After this edit, the file should look something like this:

....
remote.dc-lab.nccoe.test
....

 . Use _curl_ to download the template configuration script and configuration file(instructions found at <<_the_configuration_script>>).  Once you've modified the `lab_config.ini` file to reflect the values for your lab. It will create the appropriate directories, download each of the major configuration files, substitute in your answers and move the configuration file to the appropriate location in the file tree.  Execute the script by typing:
    
* `python3 configure_lab.py`

 . The following configuration and support files are created by the script:
    
    * guacamole/caddy/Caddyfile
    * guacamole/caddy_reload.sh
    * guacamole/docker-compose.yaml
    * guacamole/.env
    * guacamole/guacamole_build/Dockerfile

=== Setup the _MinIO_ Virtual Machine

NOTE: minIO integration for backup purposes has not been written yet.

== Installing and Configuring the Services
Each of the software components that follow are installed as Docker containers.  Each container has its own configuration scheme.  Most of the containers configure themselves and their dependencies automatically on their first run.  This is NOT the case for the OpenLDAP or Guacamole containers.  Follow these instructions in the sequence listed.

=== Installing and Configuring OpenLDAP

The first service that should be setup (if you are using it), is the OpenLDAP.  A separate docker-compose file has been downloaded called `docker-compose.yaml.initializeOpenLDAP`.  It's not clear why this is necessary, as the service entry in the compose file is the same as the normal entry, but it must be run without any other containers operating its first time for configuration to be successful.  This likely indicates some race condition between the setup process and query process, but this is speculation.  To execute this special compose file, use the command prompt to type the following lines, noting the trailing ampersand is required to regain access to the command line for subsequent steps.:

`cd /home/administrator/guacamole; docker compose create openldap`

followed by

`docker compose start openldap&`

The `&` at the end of the command is very important.  When output stops streaming to the terminal, wait about another 10 minutes then press `Enter` or `Return` and at the next command prompt type:

`docker compose down`

The OpenLDAP service should be fully configured at this point.

=== Installing and Configuring MariaDB (for use by Guacamole)

Guacamole does not automatically configure its database (hosted in MariaDB, an opensource version of MySQL).  To do so, you must first enter on the command line:


`docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --mysql > /home/administrator/guacamole/guacdb/init/initdb.sql`

This creates a database script that can be used to initialize the guacamole database.

Start a standalone MariaDB container with the following lines, noting the trailing ampersand is required on the second line to regain access to the terminal for subsequent steps:

`cd /home/administrator/guacamole; docker compose create guacdb`

followed by

`docker compose start guacdb&`

These commands start the MariaDB container with the appropriate volume mounts so that the changes we will do next are persisted.  Once the container is up and running, we open a terminal inside the container by typing:

`docker exec -it dc-lab-guac-db /bin/bash`

We will then start the `mysql` client by typing:

`mysql -p`

When prompted enter the lab password you selected in the initial script.  At the resulting `mysql` prompt, create the guacamole database by typing:

`CREATE DATABASE <lab abbreviation>_lab_guac_db;` then

`exit`

After the last command, you should be back at the _containers_ command prompt.  At this prompt, create all of the database tables and relationships by typing:

`cd /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` then

`cat 1.sql | mysql -p <lab abbreviation>_lab_guac_db`

Now, re-enter the `mysql` client by typing:

`mysql -p`

When prompted enter the lab password you selected in the initial script.  At the `mysql` prompt, grant the appropriate permissions on the new database we have just created.

`CREATE USER 'guac_db_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<lab password>';`

`GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON dc_lab_guac_db.* TO 'guac_db_user'@'%';`

`FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`

`exit`

The guacamole database has now been configured.  Exit the shell into the container by typing:

`exit` again.

Shutdown the initialized MariaDB instance by  typing:

`docker compose down`

=== Installing and Configuring phpLDAPAdmin

The phpLDAPAdmin service configures itself automatically based on the environment variables that are passed in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.  You can start the remaining services with the command line by typing:

`cd \home\administrator\guacamole; docker compose up&`

Without the `-f` flag, Docker reads the file `docker-compose.yaml` by default.

Using a browser located in a VM inside the lab, navigate to `http:\\php-LDAP-Admin.<lab abbreviation>-lab.nccoe.test`.  For OpenLDAP, the login information is:

 * Username: cn=admin,dc=<lab-abbreviation>-lab,dc=nccoe,dc=test
 * Password: <lab password you selected in the initial script>

Once logging in, you will need to use the tool to create a "Users" entry.

 . In the left sidebar, click the line saying `dc=<lab-abbreviation>-lab,dc=nccoe,dc=test`
 . Click `Create new entry here`
 . Choose `Generic: Organisational Unit`
 . Type `users` and then click `Create Object`
 . Then on new screen click `Commit`


=== Installing and Configuring MariaDB (for use by Keycloak)

Keycloak uses a MariaDB (opensource MySQL clone) to store its configuration and other identity data.  Keycloak automatically configures the database based on the environment variables named in `docker-config.yaml` file.

=== Installing and Configuring Keycloak

. Use a browser to navigate: `https://keycloak.<labAbbreviation>-lab.nccoe.test`
. Click Administration console
. login using UserName: `admin` and the lab password you selected
. Login and choose Create a Realm from the "Realm" Drop down that probably showes "Master"

==== Creating a Keycloak Client Entry for Guacamole

Select Clients from the sidebar with '<lab abbreviation>-lab' as the selected Realm.  Click create client	 then ensure the settings are as follows:

* Client type: OpenID Connect
* Client ID: guacamole
* Fill in a name and description
* Click `Save` then ensure the following fields are entered as:
* Valid redirect URIs:  https://guacamole.<lab abbreviation>-lab.nccoe.test/
* Capability config: Client authentication: off (default)
* Authentication flow:  Check ONLY standard flow and Implicit Flow 
* Click `Save` again

You can now close the browser window.

=== Installing and Configuring Guacamole

Outside of initializing the database, the most important configuration that you must do with Guacamole is completing the configuration of the administrative user.  In our implementation, users are configured in both Guacamole and Keycloak.

When you navigate to the guacamole webpage https://guacamole.<lab-abbreviation>-lab.nccoe.test/guacamole/ , you will be redirected to the Keycloak OpenID Connect client page.  Choose `Register` at the bottom of the login box.  There you will be allowed to create a new account.  The first account you should create is the corresponding `guacadmin` account.  Initially, set the password to `guacadmin` as this is the default account password created by the configuration scripts. You can change it later through Keycloak if you wish.  As configured, all accounts in a Keycloak realm must have unique email addresses, so do not associate the email address you want to use with your primary account when you set that account up.

All guacamole users can create accounts simply by following the instructions above.  Once an account has been created in Keycloak, you can assign that account to groups using the administration console (see <<_administering_guacamole>>).

=== Installing and Configuring Caddy

The initial script ensures all configuration of the Caddy service.  When TLS certificates hit their expiration date, replacements should be copied to the `/home/administratior/guacamole/certs/<service name>`.  Each certificate is represented by two files, a `.crt` file and a `.key` file, both of which should be in PEM format.

=== Administering Keycloak

Once the initial configuration is done, there is no additional maintenance that appears to be required for Keycloak.

=== Administering Guacamole

Administrative tasks in Guacamole include configuring connections, adding users to groups, and configuring connection permissions to users or groups.  One suggested way of doing this is to create a number of groups:  NCCoE-Staff, which includes government and MITRE staff, Collaborator-Staff, which would have a sub-group for each of your collaborators.  Each collaborator staff member would be assigned to the appropriate collaborator group.

=== Preparing Your Local Computer

The NCCoE does not currently serve DNS records for lab use like this, so each user will need to manually add host mappings to their operating system.  

On the machine(s) they will be accessing the lab from, add the following mapping to their manual name resolution.  On Mac and Linux machines, that will be `/etc/hosts`.  On Windows10 machines, that will be `C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.file`.  On linux and MacOS you will need to use `sudo` to make these edits.  On Windows10 you will need to run your editor as Administrator to edit the file.  Windows Notepad is an acceptable text editor, while Windows Write and Microsoft Office are not.

....
10.33.50.179    guacamole.dc-lab.nccoe.test
10.33.50.179    keycloak.dc-lab.nccoe.test
....

Developers working on this stack or other types of tasks in the lab may also wish to add the following entries:
 
....
10.33.50.179    remote.dc-lab.nccoe.test
10.33.50.179    php-ldap-admin.dc-lab.nccoe.test
10.33.50.180    minio.dc-lab.nccoe.test
....

After editing the host file on a Mac, you may need to issue the following command to ensure the new contents are used: `dscacheutil -flushcache`.  The Microsoft Edge browswer appears to work better with the hosts file than Safari.

=== Your First Sign-On

=== On-Going Use

There are no known items you need to do on an on-going basis beyond adding and removing individuals through Keycloak as members join and leave your team.

Updating the software is accomplished by pulling the latest version of each of the containers using the command `docker pull <container-name>:latest` and then restarting the docker compose stack with `docker compose restart`.  The list of container names can be determined by examining the contents of the `docker-compose.yaml`.

It's encouraged that you take regular backups of your databases.  This can be done in a few ways including shutting down the docker stack with `docker compose down`, creating a tar archive of the `/home/administrator/guacamole` folder, and then restarting the docker stack with `docker compose up&`.  It is intended that in the future these tar archives can be stored in the MinIO server.

NOTE:  TODO: Add instructions for creating a compressed tar archive.
